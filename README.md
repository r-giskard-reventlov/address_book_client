# Address Book Client

## Description

This is a client frontend to the [Address Book Server](https://github.com/r-giskard-reventlov/address-book "Address Book Server").

This application demonstrates the usage of Angular as a UI to create a simple address book application. This could
easily be extended/converted to any CRUD application.

## Installation

This application uses Bower for dependencies so as long as you have Bower on you machine:

```
bower install
```

The client assumes the server is running on `localhost:8080` so please make sure this port is unused.

## Running

The application uses npm for tooling so as long as you have `npm` on your machine:

```
npm start
```
